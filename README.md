## ** WWDC21 Swift Student Challenge Winner! - Virus Shooter [Accepted]**

# Virus-Shooter
In order to let you get familiar with the game quickly, 
I gave you information about game. After tapping the `Run My Code` button, move your iPad around and fix the score node by shooting a bullet. Once done, a crosshair will show up in the center of the screen. Then, please use the front sight (also in the center of screen) to aim the Viruses, and tap the screen to shoot them!

## Technologies I used
`Swift` `Augmented Reality` 

## How to Play
 * When the game starts, keep your iPad at the same height as your head to find the virus.
 * Scoring of game is when you shoot virus you got 1 point then points get increasing, and if you shoot the sanitizer then you will lose points and get negative scoring.
 * It is recommended to run the game in a **portrait** mode.
 * It is better to run game in **full screen portrait** mode.
